# Oil-and-gas-production-forecast
Oil and gas production forecast calculation, considering surface equipment limitation and well operating requiments

This scipt is developed for automated oil and gas production calculation for feild expiriencing assossiated gas processing constraing
It automatically considers gas capcity constraing of the surface equipment 
and considers minimum production from wells with high GOR through Min Choke parameter

Script is designed to calculate maximum oil production considering given limitations (max gas processing capacity is used for wells with lowest Gas-Oil-Ratio)
