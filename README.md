# Oil-and-gas-production-forecast
Oil and gas production forecast calculation, considering surface equipment limitation and well operating requirements

This script is developed for automated oil and gas production calculation for field experiencing associated gas processing constrain
It automatically considers gas capacity constrain of the surface equipment 
and considers minimum production from wells with high GOR through Min Choke parameter

Script is designed to calculate maximum oil production considering given limitations (max gas processing capacity is used for wells with lowest Gas-Oil-Ratio)

CONTENT:
1) Input data spreadsheet (synthetic data to demonstrate the process)
2) Script (Jupiter Notebook)

It helps identify date when well should be redrilled or (PnA)ed
